# Quick Start Guide

## ðŸš€ Get Started in 3 Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
Your ClickUp API key is already configured in `config.env`. The repository is ready to use!

### 2. IDE Configuration
Configure your IDE (Cursor, VS Code, etc.) to use the ClickUp MCP server:

**For Cursor:**
- Open Settings
- Search for "MCP"
- Add the ClickUp MCP server configuration from `setup/mcp_config.json`

**For VS Code:**
- Install the MCP extension
- Configure the ClickUp server using the provided config

### 3. Start Using AI Agents
Open your IDE and start using natural language commands:

```
"Show me all my tasks due this week"
```

```
"Create a new task called 'Review pull request #123' in the 'Code Review' list"
```

```
"Move all tasks with status 'In Progress' to 'Review'"
```
