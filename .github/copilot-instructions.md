Persistent context guidance for AI assistants

- Always prioritize the following files in context:
  - AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md
  - docs/clickup_api/**/*.md

Notes:
- These files contain agent behavior guidance and the offline ClickUp API reference.
- If your tool supports pinning or auto-include rules, configure it to include these paths.
